Simple commenting application:
The required user stories are:

 *   As a guest (no registration/authentication required), I would like to create a comment thread.
 *   As a guest, I would like to view a list of comment threads
 *   As a guest, I would like to edit or delete the any comment thread
 *   As a guest, I would like to add a post to any comment thread
 *   As a guest, I would like to reply to any post within a comment thread
 *   As a guest, I would like to see a list of all posts within any comment thread
 *   As a guest, I would like to edit or delete any post within any comment thread
 *   As a guest, I would like to view a sorted list of comment threads by date or by activity (# of posts within each thread)



notes:
  I am not using much javascript in terms of inplace editing of comments and posts, or adding new posts.  
   It shouldn't be too much more work to add but I decided that could be a v2 feature.
   Same goes for pagination.  Normally I'd break out will_paginate
   
  Also I am using all HTML5 so I have NOT tested it on IE nor done any IE support stuff.

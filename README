Simple commenting application:
The required user stories are:

 *   As a guest (no registration/authentication required), I would like to create a comment thread.
 *   As a guest, I would like to view a list of comment threads
 *   As a guest, I would like to edit or delete the any comment thread
 *   As a guest, I would like to add a post to any comment thread
 *   As a guest, I would like to reply to any post within a comment thread
 *   As a guest, I would like to see a list of all posts within any comment thread
 *   As a guest, I would like to edit or delete any post within any comment thread
 *   As a guest, I would like to view a sorted list of comment threads by date or by activity (# of posts within each thread)



notes:
  These stories lend themselves to using Cucumber to describe the features and layouts.


  Scenario: See all comments sorted by date
  Scenario: See all comments sorted by popularity

Assumption. I'm not going out and getting a "forum" plugin similar to Community Engine.
